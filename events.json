    "description": "A heroic, young, and shellshocked soldier, Wesley Hepton returns home from the trenches. To help support the family, his mother submits his art portfolio to painter Mr. Lupine. Wesley attends an interview to become his apprentice. But on arrival, he encounters another kind of madness that threatens to push him to destruction as he discovers the ulterior motives behind the artist’s palette. One of The Scotsman’s “Top Five Shows to See at the Edinburgh Fringe,” Shellshocked is a thrilling study of heroism versus cowardice.",
