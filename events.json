    "description": "A stirring new play about the growing pains and identity crises that strike at any age, and if our past determines our future. Set in the wake of the social unrest that followed the 2011 police killing of a Black man in London, Mickey finds himself struggling with precocious teenage son Jak, shelving old dreams, and doing the best he can. Father and son maintain a wary relationship until Simone, an old friend from Mickey’s past reappears, asking questions, spilling secrets, and threatening to disturb their fragile peace.",
