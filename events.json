    "description": "One Year Lease Theater presents Wake By Leon Ingulsrud and Brooke Shilling Directed by Ianthe Demos Movement Direction by Natalie Lomonte Music by Rinde Eckert and Ren With Alex J. Gould, Christina Bennett Lind, Adesola Osakalumi, Cristina Pitter, Brooke Shilling, and Akyiaa Wilson In a magical kitchen where memory, grief, and absurdity collide, a woman mourning her mother’s death navigates the messy, beautiful, and often hilarious process of letting go. Even if closure proves elusive, there is breakfast. There is warmth. There is someone sitting beside you. Can grief be metabolized like a meal? With help from her sibling, a chorus of strange visitors, and the lingering scent of brisket, Wake is a collective attempt to make peace with impermanence and find the poetry in goodbye.",
