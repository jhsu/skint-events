The piece, Wartime Elegy, jump starts the 10-day festival on Sep 18 & 19 with a New York premiere that explores the impact of tragedy, and the triumph of the human spirit. Highlights include a visceral, rock & roll contemporary ballet set to U2 songs by Complexions Contemporary Ballet; an intimate, striking duet between two artists and a solo pianist by Boston Ballet; and a timeless piece by kNoname Artist â€“ Roderick George inspired by the HIV/AIDS Epidemic set to music by Donna Summer and Diana Ross.",
