We will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the World Voices Festival with 100+ writers from 35 countries, including Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Jennifer Egan, M. Gessen, Ali Hazelwood, Dinaw Mengestu, Guadalupe Nettel, Lynn Nottage, Gary Shteyngart, and many more. You won’t want to miss timely sessions including a film screening and discussion about writing in exile, writing about the end of democracy, writing as resistance, or writing about dystopian futures. Also on the schedule is a comedy show, sessions about poetry, romance writers, women in literature, the state of censorship in American theater, and a whole lot more. Also, don’t miss the full lineup of free events open to all, including the Indie Lit Fair, the ArtLords Public Art Mural, or the House of SpeakEasy Bookmobile as well as book readings and panel discussions. Join us to bask among the celebration of free expression and literature while we still can!",
