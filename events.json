    "description": "Sara Mearns, “one of the most celebrated ballerinas in the world” (The New York Times), is the curator and performs in this year’s Artists at the Center. Mearns dances in two World Premieres—one by choreographer Guillaume Côté and writer Jonathon Young, and one by former Alvin Ailey Resident Choreographer Jamar Roberts. The program begins with Don’t Go Home, exploring the myriad challenges faced by an artist preparing for a demanding role, and the often-blurred boundary between performer and self. Then, Mearns dances in Dance Is A Mother, a world premiere by Roberts, celebrating the dualities of beauty and struggle, success and failure, featuring music by Caroline Shaw performed live by Bergamot Quartet and Raquel Acevedo Klein.",
